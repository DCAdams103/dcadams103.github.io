            <h2>The crappy website: </h2>

            <h3><a href='https://nwokillers.weebly.com/' target='_blank'>Illuminati Exposers</a></h3>

            <p class='description'>From the get-go you can tell this is an odd website, <br/> with it's tiny description in the top corner stating:<br/>
             "Destroying man made religions and traditions and <br/> exposing the churches lies. Exposing Satan and his NWO"            
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>C: The contrast for this page is a little off, especially with the title of the page being neon blue.<br/>
                    Further down the page there is yellow and green text.</li>
                <li>R: This pages layout is repetitive, with text being above or beside an image or youtube link.</li>
                <li>A: Alignment is off with the images being different sizes, and varies throughout the page.</li>
                <li>P: Proximity is good, items are close together, maybe a little too close.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The good website: </h2>

            <h3><a href='https://nakato.com/' target='_blank'>Nakato Japanese Restaurant and Sushi</a></h3>

            <p class='description'>A nice restaurant here in Charlotte. <br/> 
                They're specifically a Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi Bar.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>C: Contrast throughout the page is good. In the header they gave the<br>
                     text a colored background to make it easier to read. All the text <br/>
                     throughout the page is easy to read.
                </li>
                <li>R: Repetition throughout the page is also good, having sections that stretch<br/>
                    all the way across the page, and some sections that consist of three columns.
                </li>
                <li>A: Alignment is also good on this page, everything is centered and easy to see.</li>
                <li>P: Proximity is good on this page, everything is evenly spaced and nothing feels cluttered. </li>
            </ul>
